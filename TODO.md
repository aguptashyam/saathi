# TODO: Change Chatbot from Hugging Face to Gemini API

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Update requirements.txt to replace transformers/torch with google-generativeai
- [x] Modify app.py to use Gemini API instead of Hugging Face model
- [x] Replace response generation logic with Gemini API calls
- [x] Keep mental health keyword responses intact
- [x] Set GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable
- [x] Install updated dependencies (run install.bat or pip install -r requirements.txt)
- [x] Test the chatbot microservice
- [x] Verify responses are generated correctly

## Notes
- Ensure GEMINI_API_KEY is set as an environment variable before running the microservice
- The microservice runs on port 5001
- Mental health keyword responses are preserved for specific terms like depression, anxiety, etc.
- General responses now use Gemini API with mental health context
- Successfully tested with sample message "Hello, I am feeling a bit stressed"
- Response: "Hello there! I'm Saathi and it's okay to feel stressed sometimes..."
- Flask app is running successfully on http://localhost:5001
- Health endpoint working: GET /health returns {"status": "healthy", "service": "saathi-chatbot"}
- Chat endpoint working: POST /chat returns AI-generated empathetic responses
